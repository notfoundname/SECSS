# cstrike-modding
This repository contains files and information for easier and less painful modding and mapping of Counter-Strike: Source.

# Installation
1. Drag & Drop everything into Counter-Strike: Source folder (where cstrike, hl2, bin, platform and hl2.exe are located);
2. Install [Hammer++ for CS:S](https://ficool2.github.io/HammerPlusPlus-Website/download.html) (drop into bin folder, don't launch yet);
3. Install [Slammin' Source Tools](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gqmMkHTadUmWBMOqSPSlKRLL1zYvoRsS/view) (drop into bin folder with file replacing);
4. Create shortcut for Hammer++: add to the object field (first one): `-game "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Source\cstrike"` (based on where the cstrike folder is located);
